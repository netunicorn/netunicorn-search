# Iterative Experiment

This folder contains code for the iterative experiment design, presented in Sections 5.2 and 5.3.

Folders `0_initial`, `1_iteration`, and `2_iteration` contain the code for the initial, first, and second iterations of the experiment accordingly. Each folder contains the datasets, experiment code, exploration, and preprocessing notebooks, including comparison with exogenous methods (see Section 5.3).

The folder `3_ood_example` contains code for the "Attack adaptation" part of Section 5.4. 

We also include shell scripts (see `preprocessing-1`, `preprocessing-2`, and `preprocessing-ood` scripts for information about initial PCAP preprocessing for all iterations.
